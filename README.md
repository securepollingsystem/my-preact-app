<h3 align="center">Get started using Preact and Vite!</h3>

## Getting Started

-   `npm run dev` - Starts a dev server at http://localhost:5173/ or whatever port is configured in vite.config.js
-   `npm run dev -- --host` - same as above but allows for connections to other than localhost, such as external IP address

-   `npm run build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`

-   `npm run preview` - Starts a server at http://localhost:4173/ to test production build locally
-   `npm run preview -- --port 8990 --host` - same as above but on port 8990 and allows connections from outside localhost
